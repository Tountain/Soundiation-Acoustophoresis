There are two data files can be created by Soundiation:
- The geometric data file "particle_data.stl": the particle geometry is designed by the user.
- The dynamic data file "MyFilename.txt" (in default): it saves the time-variant dynamic process (position and angle coordinates) of a user-specified particle, and the parameters used in calculation.
